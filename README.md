A Chatbot is a software that simulates human-like conversations using predefined rules or AI. It can assist with customer support, automation, and virtual assistance. Chatbots are used in messaging apps, websites, and businesses to improve efficiency. They can be rule-based with fixed responses or AI-driven, using NLP to generate replies.
